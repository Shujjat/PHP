# PHP based projects

In this repository, you will find introduction to my projects that I made using PHP and its frameworks. 

Usually I will not share complete projects since they are in use by the clients and doing so may harm their interests. 


### Kerberous
(Cerberus, in Greek mythology, the monstrous watchdog of the underworld. He was usually said to have three heads, though the poet Hesiod (flourished 7th century BCE) said he had 50. Heads of snakes grew from his back, and he had a serpent's tail.(Google search))
